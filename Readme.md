# Lazer Puzzle

This is a prototype of a mini-game concept for a bigger game that we're working on.  I'm building
it out as my "one game a month" project for February 2013.  Art is thanks to [Glenn Martin](http://www.parismartin.com/NewSite/gpm_home.html).

How to play: rotate the pieces until the lasers reach the sensors.  When all the sensors are
activated, you win!
